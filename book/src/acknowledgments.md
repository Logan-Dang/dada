# Acknowledgments

Dada is designed by me ([nikomatsakis]), but heavily based on ideas from [Lark], which was a joint project by [nikomatsakis], [wycats], and [JT].

[Ralf Jung]'s work on [stacked borrows] is a key ingredient for Dada's operational semantics and overall approach.

I found [Felienne Herman]'s book [The Programmer's Brain] quite intriguing, and I've been leaning on the framework it suggests as I iterate and thinking about the experience of learning Dada. I feel confident it is showing up in here.

I also want to highlight [Lionel Parreaux]'s work on [Seagl]. It has a lot of similarities to Dada's leases and Polonius's origins. Parreaux described it to me many years ago and I didn't fully appreciate the power of this direction at the time. Cool stuff.
